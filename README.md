# BoxHead
This is my BoxHead game

To run this program you'll need to install Pygame. The other packages the game uses dosent require installation, its built in functions in your editor,
so to run this program you only need to install pygame, from your cmd, you intall pygame by writing "pip install pygame" in your cmd or terminal editor.

You will need python3 to use this program, just clone my project to get all the files and images for the game.

The game dosen't require any commands to run, just go to the directory you put the folder in cmd and write "python BoxHead.py" or run the file from your editor. Both methods are the same.
